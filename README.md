# Portfolio
It is my personal portfolio web app project developed using html css javascript and some bootstrap code. In this portfolio website i have added nav section logo and one background image and then about section services section project section and then contact section where my all social links are given and there is one contact form attached also.
My aim behind developing this portfolio site was to build a website where i can attach all the necessaries information about my career education skills experiences interests and my social media handles so if anyone wants to know about whether it is about my professional career background or education background can visit my portfolio website rather reading any resume cv as i think a visually appealing layout can make the experience of learning about someone more engaging and enjoyable.
For some reason i have attached all the javascript code inside html file itself .
